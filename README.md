tcdd-api-client
---------------
A simple, Pythonic way to convert [TCDD's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_State_Railways) timetable system to an usable API. This project is pretty much WIP, and hence the most of library other than the main logic has not been established.
The source of timetable can be browsed [here.](https://ebilet.tcddtasimacilik.gov.tr/view/eybis/tnmGenel/tcddWebContent.jsf)
To set it up, download the repository and put it to your project. Unfortunately there's not any versions in PIP yet, as the project is missing some of the essential functions required.
